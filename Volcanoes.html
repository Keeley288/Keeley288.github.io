	<h1> Volcanoes </h1>
	<h2> What is a volcano? </h2>
	<p>
A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic sah, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.

	</p>
	<h2> Why do Volcanoes Occur? </h2>
	<p>
	Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broekn into 17 major, rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle.
	Therfore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater.
	Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crusts plates, e.g. in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field.
